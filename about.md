What am I? That's a question I've been asking for long! I'm not very near to answering it. Considering the ways I have travelled and things I've done, I can assure that I'm far from answering that question. I can try to address someone else, but I can't. What's the point anyway?

What is this? This is a place where I write notes about decision making. I read a lot, I think more, imagine some, and I act from time to time. I make certain experiments also on occasion. Whatever be it, I write things here, mainly for my own gratification, my own improvement and not for anyone else. 

Why publish? I am an exhibitionist. Or I don't know what to write about or whatever. Okay, let me try a serious explanation. The thing is, when I started the blog, the purpose was: *" The purpose of the blog is to improve my decision making while also increasing the decision making skills of my readers."* So, yes, I kind of started with a motive of using the reciprocal rule to my own benifit, but then I decided it'd be too difficult to manage, that it'll put too many filters on my thought streams and that I won't enjoy doing it. So, there I learned the first lesson in decision making which can be stated in many ways:

**Choose the simplest goal possible**
**Choose the goal that reduces your burden but at the same time maintains good amount of profit**

I may have to tune this in the future.

So, starting this blog has profited me on the first day itself. I hope for more profits!

I notice I still haven't addressed the "why publish?" question entirely. Again, why not? If someone reads what I write and finds some error in my thinking, then I'd profit!
If someone finds me useful in his work and offers me work, then why not!
If someone find my thoughts alluring and irresistible and marry me or something, great!

Okay, the last one was an exaggeration. What I mean to say is simple: there's no loss in publishing it. So I'm publishing it.
