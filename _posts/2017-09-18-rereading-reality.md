The point of decision making as a discipline is to ultimately obtain desired outcomes for ourselves. We like to believe that by reading reality, interpreting it accurately through mental models and doing calculations, we can achieve better outcomes for ourselves. Many of us have personally experienced that getting better at any of the steps of decision making leads to better outcomes.

If I calculate better, I spend money wisely and bring material success to myself.

If I use universal principles of human behavior to understand people, then I tend to be more successful at getting what I want from and through people.

While calculating, learning principles can be done through hard study. But reading reality is a different kind of skill altogether. 

Here what is required the most is the readyness of our senses to capture information from the world around it. 

What do I see
What do I hear
What do I touch
What do I smell
What do I taste

Of these five, vision -- what we see is the most important form of input.
Audiotory - what we hear is the second most important form of input.
Sensing - what we touch is the third most important form of input.

All decision making depend on the accurate capture of information in the reading reality stage.

Training our senses to take the most accurate version of input is a moral duty for every human being. Rationality is dependent upon it. 

## How do I train the vision?

Perhaps artists would know better, especially the old master Leonardo Da Vinci. He understood vision to a depth that no other person did. While it's great that he understood it, what can we glean from him? Before we do that, let me think for myself.

Let's say I'm looking at a thing. Is it a good idea to name it? Is it a good idea to describe the object through lines on a paper, since points and lines are fundamental ideas for representing objects visually? Charlie Munger said that we must describe something using the most fundamental concepts possible.

One more idea is to focus on getting specific about the things we see. I mean to say that we have to really look at things and be specific about things. Yesterday I saw a person wearing a yellow shirt, initially. Then I decided to actually train my vision. Do you know what was the final description that I arrived at?

	The man wore a dark golden colored sweatshirt with a full length zip and no whiskers. What he wore wasn't a pullover since they seem not to have full length zips.

Now, the above observation is more in tune with reality. A person can learn a lot from this -- the color is very specific, its characteristics (length of zip and the detail about whiskers), and there's also a disambiguation with a similar garment.

Would it be so that observing things in this way be useful to us in some way? Obviously, writers can benefit from such an outlook for sure, since they are always looking to make their descriptions more interesting. But for other people, such as a programmer or a clerk, does it make any difference?

Let me try to advance argument#1 in support of deep observation.
