* TOC
{:toc}

Oh, the mistakes I make!

+ Saying things that I regret later (social indiscipline)
+ Forgetting my keys, books, etcetera (lack of order)
+ Underestimating how long it'll take me to write this post (wishful thinking)
+ Letting fear/anxiety/anger/circumstances get the best of me (emotional reasoning issues)
+ Forgetting to clean my hair, cut my nails or something of the kind (hygiene issues)

And many more.

Mistakes are painful.

Mistakes cause loss; personal, business, economic.

Mistakes are things we all would like to avoid.

But then, it's so... hard isn't it?

Maybe you tell yourself it's okay to make mistakes.

May be you say...

## ... failure is the step to success?

For example Charlie Munger said:

> I like people admitting they were complete stupid horses’ asses. I know I’ll perform better if I rub my nose in my mistakes. This is a wonderful trick to learn.

Maybe he was right. I can learn so much from my mistakes, right?

For example, I can **learn** from my mistakes that:

+ I am forgetful
+ I miscalculate
+ I have negative emotions
+ I don't have perfect discipline

## All these things...

... Sound less like *mistakes* per se, and more like the **problem of being human**.

+ Humans have weak long term memory by default
+ Calculation involves heavy congnitive load
+ We are creatures of sentiment
+ Our brain craves for novelty, not routine/discipline

## So, how to stop making mistakes of being human?

Checklists.

## Quick examples

### Example 1: For learning/Teaching

A checklist for teaching yourself a difficult idea (or for creating clear explanations)

### Example 2: Cockpit pilot

http://www.303rdbg.com/checklist-cockpit.html

Cockpit Checklists were utilized many years before WWII by both the Military and Airlines and many private pilots.
[Pilots have used Cockpit Checklists from WWII times.

From the early days of flying, pilots have found it indispensable the use of Cockpit check lists in avoiding plane accidents.]

We do not know when the first checklist was printed.

The number of procedures necessary for the safe and efficient operation of large aircraft (as well as smaller aircraft) are far too many for even the most experienced pilot to safely memorize.

Even the best trained pilots are likely to forget things on occasion.

The cockpit checklist is the only sure safeguard.

Where there is both a pilot and copilot, the copilot takes the checklist in hand and, in a clear loud voice, calls out each item.

The specific operation or check is then performed, either by the pilot or copilot (as specified in the checklist), whereupon the pilot or co-pilot repeats aloud the item as “Checked."

In single engine aircraft the pilot reviews his checklist alone.

A large number of accidents that were classified as pilot’s error were the direct result of the pilot and copilot failing to fully and properly utilize their checklist, forgetting one or more item.

One mistake, one switch improperly set or one instrument overlooked was an invitation for disaster.

[This can also be an analogy to decision making itself. That is, if a problem solver fails to cover all the bases, then his solution can be of lower quality and hence the result not achieved.

Avoiding mistakes is the name of the game. In decision making, errors are not your friend. Every error can you cost you. A wrong thought may lead to a social mistake which may cause the loss of a friend. A wrong caclulation can lead to loss of money. A wrong method me lead you to a wrong answer.]












### Example 3: Munger's Investment checklist

Charlie Munger’s Investment checklist

### Example 4: My Hygiene checklist

1. Hair - short, combed, oiled
2. Teeth - brushed twice
3. Hands - Nails, hand wash
4. Public hair - shaved/trimmed
5. Body - washed and deodorant
6. Clothes - washed, comfortable, uncrumpled
7. Shoes & Socks - clean & fresh

### Example 5: Problem solving checklist

1. Clear and Crisp REPRESENTATION
2. Don't let words misguide you. Mind is over words on book. Think 100 times more than you read.
3. Take 60 second break when feeling exhausted
4. Apply Occam’s razor — check the SIMPLEST assumption first
5. Invert, always invert
6. Ask what is required. What is it that the problem/people WANT (not what *I* want). Set aside *my* needs. (Think deeply of the world, lightly of yourself).
7. Recheck!! — Am I going by plausible reasoning? Am I satisfysing?
8. What is 100% TRUE in this context?
9. Think at least upto the 3rd order consequence


### Example 5: Carl Braun's the 5 W’s of writing a memo


Charlie Munger references Braun’s five W’s, a checklist for writing memos:

> “His rule for all the Braun Company’s communications was called the five W’s ‐ you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when and why. And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and you didn’t tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice.

> You might ask why that is so important? Well, again that’s a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you always tell people why, they’ll understand it better, they’ll consider it more important, and they’ll be more likely to comply. Even if they don’t understand your reason, they’ll be more likely to comply.

## Self-reflection time

Ask yourself these questions:

* What is the cost of the mistakes I made?
* How does one mistake lead to another?
* How do I identify my own mistakes?
* Which recurring mistakes could be avoided by a checklist?

[x fix grammar]

## How does one use a checklist?

* There are two types of checklists
    * **Do-Confirm checklists** You go through the motions (such as a hygiene routine) and then take a look at the checklist and make sure you've covered all the items.
    * **Read-Do checklists** You read each item (such as a problem solving technique) and then perform it till the end of the list.


## Rules for formulating checklists

[insert from Atul's book]


## Not all mistakes are bad!

Niccolò Machiavelli said:

> Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.


**It's important to remember that checklists shouldn't curtail innovation or kill intuition.**

## Take it from these great men...

... who thought making mistakes of ambition and learning from then and then avoiding them critical to getting what you want from life:

* Ray Dalio
* Charlie Munger
* Machieavelli
* [Checklist manifesto author]
* [That investor dude in checklist manifesto]
* [Super pilot]

:white_check_mark: Making mistakes is necessary
:white_check_mark: Recognizing them as such is important
:white_check_mark: Admitting them is important
:white_check_mark: Understanding them is important
:white_check_mark: Learning from them is important

Learning means avoiding repeating the mistake again. Who wouldn’t want to avoid repeating their mistakes and thus improve life in general or achieve business success?

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

List some relevant people who understand the power of the thing (those successful people did it, so should you)

Wouldn’t you want to be part of the group of great men who realized the importance of making mistakes but then avoiding them?




Give some personal insight in bullet point format
* Social discipline problem
* Problem solving improvement
* Personal hygiene
* Gym routine

Suggest a book or two
The checklist manifesto & Charlie Munger





Give a short summary of some great man, followed by a relevant quote of his. Maybe explain his method in bullet point format.

Give some usable stuff

* Conciseness
* 1 page
* clear type
* stuff


Recommend one more book, with some great man's testimonial.


And more of it


Then, make a final bullet point summary and a call for action (doing this is good for you)
