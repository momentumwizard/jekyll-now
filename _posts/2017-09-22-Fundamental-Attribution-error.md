## What you do is what you are...

... and What I do is what the circumstances dictate me to do. If someone didn't respond to your text, then it's because he's selfish. If you didn't respond to someone else's text, it's because you were swamped with too much work. If someone didn't speak to you, it's because he's arrogant. If you didn't speak to someone else, it's because you were feeling down that day. See the pattern? We judge others harshly, we believe what they do emerges from their internal attributes. However, we judge ourselves leniently and attribute external factors to drive our actions.

## The naive scientist

Fritz Heider proposed the idea that humans are driven by rational calculation, for both complex and routine actions. Naive scientists seek consistency and stability that comes from a coherent view of the world, they seek to control the environment. To develop such views, naive scientists make attributions. Through such attributions, humans are able to make up explanations that provide them a sense of security. 

## Attributional biases

The naive scientist theory started research into attributional biases:

1. Fundamental attribution error
2. Actor-observer bias
3. Self-serving bias
4. Hostile attribution bias


Actor-observer bias is an extension of FAE. A student may explain her studying by referencing situational factor ("I have an exam coming up") whereas others will explain her studying by referencing dispositional factors ("She is ambitious and hard working"). The extra point added here is that we over-value dispositional explanation of others' behaviors, and over-value situational explanations of our own behavior.

Self-serving bias refers to the idea that we attribute our successes to internal factors and failures to external. The student says, "I scored well because I'm intelligent" and "I couldn't score well because the teacher is unfair". We cook up such explanations to feel better about ourselves. It is an ego protection mechanism. 

Hostile attribution bias has been defined as an interpretation lens people have, for example when a child sees two other children talking, the child thinks they have hostile intent, and this leads to aggression. 

## The cognitive miser

The focused study of these biases lead to a more conclusion about humans. We came to realise that we aren't really scientists doing calculations, rather we interpret reality through biased lenses. The biases may help us or harm us depending on how they act together. Anyway, a superior explanation of our own behavior is through the idea of heuristics -- we are cognitive misers, we make decisions using mental shortcuts, we don't think through problems, big or small. Acting as congnitive misers is rational because we have to process a huge volume of information/stimuli.

## Expert miser and novice miser

There's an opinion going around that cognitive misery helps experts make good decisions when given complex problems and that when beginners act with cognitive misery, disastrous decisions are made. This could or could not be true, I'm not sure about it. Having an opinion on this seems pretty impossible and I don't see why I'd need to do that.

## So what?

These facts, when deeply thought about open up new possibilties in understanding reality. I start off with the assumption that a more accurate understanding of the world is a good thing to have. I believe accurate understanding of reality as the truth. What practical implications do these ideas give us?

## Socially

When a person isn't talking to you, it's probably because of the situation they are in, and not because of they hate you or find you stupid. 

The station of life a person is in is probably largely due to situational factors. We don't know what a person has gone through.

While you may know about FAE, the other person may not know about it or even care about it. There's a good chance that the person you are looking at you is making snap judgments about you and labeling you and putting on attributes on you and then making decisions based on that.

If your surface attributes do not create an accurate attributional process in the other person, then it's your fault, not theirs. It is stupid to expect most people to understand you. So it's your job to present yourself as you want to be seen.

## Always consider the situation

No matter who the person is, pay more attention to the situation. 
Try to empathize with the other person, this means avoid making the fundamental attribution error. Think like the person would think.

You understand a person if you say, "She's studying because she has exams coming up" instead of "She's studying because she's ambitious and hard working".

You understand a person when you say "He's working hard at this because he wants a promotion so that he can avoid pain" instead of "He's working hard because he's a naturally hard working person"

You understand a person when you say "You're having a bad day because you're being treated unfairly by those in authority" instead of "You're having a bad day because you lack self control"

You understand a person when you say "Your boss is being demanding and putting pressure on you" instead of "You aren't strong enough to handle reality or you lack qualities to handle the situation".

**Avoiding FAE is the first step towards genuine understanding of reality and hence powerful empathy**

## Think about your situation, not you

Don't call yourself lazy, but try to understand why you aren't able to work. Is it because you don't know what to do, how to do, or is it because you're sick and tired, or is it because you are bothered by other problems.

Don't beat yourself with all kinds of attributes, don't think you're stupid or intelligent. Just focus on the tasks and situations and work on them.

For example, when learning a new skill, don't judge yourself very harshly. Just look at which level are you in, when seen from the dreyfus model. Are you a novice? Are you an advanced beginner? Competent? Proficient? Expert? 

No matter where you are, it's probably not you, it's just the situation you are in.

Learn to judge yourself and others with consideration and kindness. Be empathetic to you and others. That'll make life way more fun and enjoyable in the long run.
