I have always thought independence was the most important quality of a great decision maker. Taking in all the information going around him, interpreting it, identifying major factors, weighing them each with proper priority, applying them to the problem at hand or trouble on shoulders, and then making perfect decisions. Basically, "reading" reality, interpreting it and making perfect decisions, completely devoid of any help. Reading my own thoughts as it is written in last sentence, the assumption seems contradictory.

Shouldn't  Mr. Decision Maker collect information from others?
Isn't he reliant on books for facts?
Doesn't he rely on formulas from others?

Thinking about the question more deeply, Newton published his theory of how the eye works, and Goethe didn't agree with it, so he came with a theory of his own, which turned out to be partially right. He was clearly propelled by thoughts that were initiated by Newton. So, in some way Goethe was guided by Newton. And Goethe was a decision maker of great skill, producing amazing works in a range of fields. We don't know who pushed Newton, but he's famous for his "I've stood on the shoulders of giants" comment, so he's also a great proponent of learning from others.

Chanakya the total decision maker emphasised the acquiring of knowledge of others, learning the scriptures, learning at least half a sutra a day. He said one can't afford to learn through one's own mistakes so one must learn from others mistakes.

Seems like the idea that an "independent" decision maker is not very valuable. Great decision makers have emphasised the "learning" as the paramount quality when it comes to decision making. As Charlie Munger says, the best decision maker is the one who "Swims with the tide"...

+ **Learning is the most important quality of a decision maker, not independence**

As some sadhguru said, When in the morning you aren't afraid, because you can see everything with clarity... Only when cometh the night, when you can't see anything you are afraid... So.. one must acquire whatever is necessary in this world to see things with clarity... in this case it seems like Learning is the quality that a decision maker needs to see things clearly so that one can live without any fear.
