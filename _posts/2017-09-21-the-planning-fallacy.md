## What is planning fallacy

The planning fallacy talks about how bad we are at making predictions concerning how long a task will take to complete. Given a goal, we predict it to be easily done, but once we actually try to accomplish it, we usually take longer than predicted or sometimes even abandon the task. Even experienced task executioners will commit this dangerous fallacy  (unless he knows about the planning fallacy and it is part of his mental models). This is an extremely important fallacy to be aware of for any smart person because using this one can curb the natural over optimism present in our cognitive processes.

## Better ask others 

It's a good idea to ask others about the time frame it will take to complete a task because they will tend to evaluate the task more objectively. Especially, it's a superior path to consult experts about the task you are going to execute. While the experts may overestimate their own abilities regarding their ability to quickly execute tasks, they will in general be more pessimistic about your abilities. This makes sense because we as humans are always trying to justify our own abilities to ourselves, we see ourselves sympathetically. A criminal is never a criminal in his own mind. However, we are not naturally inclined to shower sympathy on others. The smart thing to do is to use these facts to our own advantage and ask someone about how long will it take to actually complete the task.

## It's not just about time

Planning fallacy applies not only to time predictions, it applies to cost and benefits also. When a person is executing a task, he thinks he can get it done cheaply while also thinking that it'll get him a lot of benefits. So, when we estimate, we tend to think it'll take less money to execute something and that we'll get more benefits from executing the task. 

## Applies for both individuals and groups

Groups are made up of individuals, and so in groups the problem magnifies hundred fold. 	

Sydney Opera House was expected to completed by 1963, but a scaled down version was done 10 years later, at 1973. Original cost estimate was $7 million, while the final cost was $102 million. 

This is only one example, one can find more throughout the globe and all over history. 

## Explanation #1: We don't use our memories

The planner, being guided by his vision and the great benefits his plan will bring, tends to forget about the problems that may come up in his way. He selectively forgets his experience and in turn engages in wishful thinking. The great executor Elon Musk has mentioned this in couple of his talks saying how important it is to curb wishful thinking when we are planning. Others less well known, example Roger Buehler also attributed planning fallacy to wishful thinking.

## Explanation #2: Self serving bias

There's no argument about it: we care about ourselves more than others. It's helpful in survival and so by nature, by design we are built to be self surving. The universe doesn't care about you, only you care about yourself. And other people may or may not care about you, depending on how important you are to their survival (and reproductive) needs. Ultimately much of our actions can be easily explained through our survival and reproductive needs (at the lowest level) or through pain avoidance principle (at a little higher level). Coming back to the explanation, we interpret our past plans and executions in a very biased way: that is, we take credit for things that went right and blame outside influences for things that go wrong. People interpret the pas evidence boosting their on swlf images. This is part of impression management theory, that we try to look good in front of others, because social survival means ultimate survival and also fulfilment of reproductive needs.

## Explanation 3: We don't get the future

When the dealine of a task is far and is not near approaching, we are relaxed about completing it, which in turn makes us relaxed in making a prediction. We can come up with lots of thoughts that seem like they will take us to success. This leads us into making optimistic predictions. Simply put: when there's a lot of time remaining, we are in an optimistic mood, generate more thoughts, feel success easily achievable and hence make inaccurate predictions. The task at hand is very challenging because we don't have a lot of time on our hands, hence we are in a more realistic mood than optimistic and we perceive the odds of success more clearly and hence we are more likely to make accurate predictions.

## Fixing it: Segmentation effect

One idea to fixing it is this: total time allocated to a high level task is significantly smaller than the sum of the time allocated to individual smaller sub-tasks. So, once we are aware of the effect, that this happens, we can work around that. So what we do is define the sub tasks and determine how each of it takes to complete. Once we add up, we will know that our initial estimate for the final task was smaller than what it should be. Basically, the idea is to do simple arithmetic to fix our own estimates. The only problem is that for big projects, such elaborate calculations may involve a lot of overhead. Moreover, this will be too much of an effort in our daily lives.

## One more idea: Implementation intentions

Implementation intention is the idea of making tasks clear and concrete. It is defining accurately how, when and where one will act. This will increase the executor's will power and make them more optimistic. It will also increase commitments. For example, while starting the blog post, I set the target as: 1000 words, get 10 insights on the topic, and explain each insight with 100 words adding up to 1000 words. And know what? It worked. I'd never have achieved this much in such a small period of time if I wasn't as concrete as I was in my plan specification. From personal experience, it seems to me that having such concrete specification helps me stay focused on the task more and taking it to the conclusion. 

> People tend to underestimate how long it will take to complete tasks. We suggest that one reason people commit this planning fallacy is that they do not naturally “unpack” multifaceted tasks (e.g., writing a manuscript) into subcomponents (completing the literature review, general discussion, references section, etc.) when making predictions. We tested this interpretation by asking participants to estimate how long it would take them to complete one of several tasks: holiday shopping in Experiment 1, “getting ready” for a date in Experiment 2, formatting a document in Experiments 3 and 5, and preparing food in Experiment 4. Participants prompted to unpack the task provided longer—and, in Experiments 3–4, less biased—estimates of how long the task would take than did participants who did not. Experiment 5 showed that the debiasing influence of unpacking is moderated by task complexity: the more multifaceted the task, the greater the influence of unpacking.

## Another solution: Reference class forecasting

This is the most powerful forecasting method there is. It is similar to asking others, only that it is more rigorous.

If you're writing a software, goto a company that has done a similar project and figure out how long it took them. Also figure out why it took them such an amount of time.

If you're building a building, get in touch with those who've done something similar already and figure out the time.

Most importantly: Listen to their estimate. Chances are: you won't be able to change much in it, no matter how better you get, there's a good chance that you'll be somewhere near the one who did it before you. Of course, radical change is possible, but it is not probable.



## Conclusion?

Ask others, listen to them closely, have specific, clear and concrete plans and always be on the look out for planning fallacy and whenever you see it, counteract ASAP.
